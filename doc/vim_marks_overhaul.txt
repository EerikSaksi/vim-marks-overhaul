                                        *vim_marks_overhaul-overview*
1. Overview~
This overrides and extends on some of vim's mark features.

- All marks are global
  This includes lower case marks. The location of marks in files is not saved, so you will instead jump to where you were editing most recently.

- Different marks for different projects
  If you're not inside a git project, the global marks are used. Otherwise, project specific marks are used automatically.

- Warns when overriding marks
  If you try to assign a mark to a file that is already used, a warning prompt will appear.

- Warns when double referencing file
  If you have already assigned a mark to the current file, a warning will appear, and proceeding erases the old mark.

- Reminders for marks
  If you access a file that has been marked through other means (such as through NERDTree) an echo will execute reminding you of the mark that was assigned to this file.

- Support for NERDTree
  Executing a jump will first close NERDTree (if plugin exists) to avoid opening the buffer in the small left side window.

2. Features~
  

- Override default vim marks

  
  * change default bindings 
      nnoremap <silent> ' :OverhaulJump <CR>
      nnoremap <silent> m :OverhaulMark<CR>
  


  * Change cache directory:
    let g:vim_marks_overhaul#marks_file_path = $HOME ".cache/vim-marks-overhault"

  * Use the last git repos mark files when launching instead of globals (if you worked on git project bogosort when last using vim, bogosorts marks will be used even outside of the project until you enter another git project)
    let g:vim_marks_overhaul#use_globals = 0
