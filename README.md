# vim-bujo

This plugin allows people to easily access and manage todo lists for their projects from vim.

You can easily access and manage Todo lists of specific projects or a general Todo list.

## Installation

If you use a plugin manager, such as [vim-plug], follow its instructions on how to install plugins from github.

To install the stable version of the plugin, if using [vim-plug], put this in your `vimrc`/`init.vim`:

```
Plug 'vuciv/vim-bujo'
```

We can also see that the task list is very easy to manage.

The ascii art is inserted manually, but you can do that yourself with the file 'templates/md.skeleton'


## Notes

Feedback and bug reports are welcomed and encouraged.
If you want new features, please do let me know. I
would be honored at the opportunity to make a tool
better for the community.

I built this because I wanted the ease of vim bindings
with the benefits of keeping a todo list on hand. It is
very simple and minimialist. 

I plan to add diary capabilities, and all the fun little 
quotes and activities that make actual bullet journaling fun!
